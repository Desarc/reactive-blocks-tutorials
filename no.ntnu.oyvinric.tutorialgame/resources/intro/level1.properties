initial_text=In Reactive Blocks, an application is executed by creating one or more control tokens that is passed through the various blocks\n and nodes in the program in a series of steps. Whenever a token passes through a node, \nsome application logic is performed, and the token continues to the next node. For example,\n if this node is an Operation, the application will run the code associated with the \noperation. When the application is first started, one token is created in each of the Initial Nodes present. The token then moves along the Edge \nconnected to the Initial Node to the next element. Finally, when any token reaches an Activity Final node, \nall tokens stop flowing and the application is terminated.
